# New TROLL

In case of a new TROLL version the following changes need to be made to the C++ for use with Rcpp in rcontroll:

-   Adding the Rcpp header

-   Transforming main() in trollCpp() with documentation

-   Replacing the bufi by the Rcpp inputs

-   Removing all the exit()

-   Replacing all cout by Rcout, cerr by Rcerr

-   Adding parenthesis to avoid the corresponding warning

Do not hesitate to add missing changes.

    using namespace Rcpp;
