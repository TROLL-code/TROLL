#' `rcontroll`: individual-based forest growth simulator TROLL
#'
#' `TROLL` is coded in C++ and it typically simulates hundreds of thousands of
#' individuals over hundreds of years. The `rcontroll` R package is a wrapper of
#' `TROLL`. `rcontroll` includes functions that generate inputs for simulations
#' and run simulations. Finally, it is possible to analyse the `TROLL` outputs
#' through tables, figures, and maps taking advantage of other R visualisation
#' packages. `rcontroll` also offers the possibility to generate a virtual LIDAR
#' point cloud that corresponds to a snapshot of the simulated forest.
#'
#' # Construction and manipulation of input files
#'
#' As stated above, three types of input data are needed for a typical `TROLL`
#' simulation:   (i) climate data, (ii) plant functional traits, (iii) global
#' model parameters. Pre-simulation functions include global parameters
#' definition (`generate_parameters` function) and climate data generation
#' (`generate_climate` function).  `rcontroll` also includes default data for
#' species and climate inputs for a typical French Guiana rainforest site.  The
#' purpose of the `generate_climate` function with the help of the corresponding
#' vignette is to create `TROLL` climate inputs from ERA5-Land (Muñoz-Sabater et
#' al. 2021), a global climatic reanalysis dataset that is freely available. The
#' ERA5-Land climate reanalysis is available at 9 km spatial resolution and
#' hourly temporal resolution since 1950, and daily or monthly means are
#' available and their uncertainties reported. Therefore, `rcontroll` users only
#' need to input the species-specific trait data to run `TROLL` simulations,
#' irrespective of the site. `TROLL` was originally developed for tropical and
#' subtropical forests, so certain assumptions must be critically examined when
#' applying it outside the tropics. The input files can be used to start a
#' `TROLL` simulation run within the `rcontroll` environment (see below), or
#' saved so that the `TROLL` simulation can be started as a command line tool.
#'
#' # Simulations
#'
#' The default option is to run a `TROLL` simulation using the `troll` function
#' of the rcontroll package, which currently calls version 3.1.7 of `TROLL`
#' using the Rcpp package (Eddelbuettel & François 2011). The output is stored
#' in a `trollsim` R class. For multiple runs, users can rely on the `stack`
#' function, and the output is stored in the `trollstack` class. Both `trollsim`
#' and `trollstack` values can be accessed using object attributes in the form
#' of simple R objects (with `@` in R). They consist of eight simulation
#' attributes: (1) name, (2) path to saved files, (3) parameters, (4) inputs,
#' (5) log, (6) initial and final state, (7) ecosystem output metrics, and (8)
#' species output metrics. The initial and final states are represented by a
#' table with the spatial position, size and other relevant traits of all trees
#' at the start and end of the simulation. The ecosystem and species metrics are
#' summaries of ecosystem processes and states, such as net primary production
#' and aboveground biomass, and they are documented at species level and
#' aggregated over the entire stand. Simulations can be saved using a
#' user-defined path when run and later loaded as a simple simulation
#' (`load_output` function) or a stack of simulations (`load_stack` function).
#'
#' # Simulated airborne lidar scanning option
#'
#' `TROLL` also has the capacity of generating point clouds from virtual aerial
#' lidar scannings of simulated forest scenes. Within each cubic metre voxel of
#' the simulated stand, points are generated probabilistically, with the
#' probability depending both on the amount of light reaching the particular
#' voxel and the amount of leaf matter intercepting light within the voxel.
#' Extinction and interception of light are based on the Beer-Lambert law, but
#' an effective extinction factor is used to account for differences between the
#' near-infrared and visible light. The definition of the lidar parameters
#' (`generate_lidar` function) is optional but allows the user to add a virtual
#' aerial lidar scan for a time step of the `TROLL` simulation. When this option
#' is enabled, the cloud of points from simulated aerial lidar scans are stored
#' as LAS using the R package `lidR` (Roussel et al., 2020) as a ninth attribute
#' of the `trollsim` and `trollstack` objects.
#'
#' # Manipulation of simulation outputs
#'
#' `rcontroll` includes functions to manipulate simulation outputs. Simulation
#' outputs can be retrieved directly from the `trollsim` or `trollstack`objects
#' and summarised or plotted in the R environment with the `print`, `summary`
#' and `autoplot` functions. The `get_chm` function allows users to retrieve
#' canopy height models from aerial lidar point clouds. In addition, a
#' `rcontroll` function is available to visualise TROLL simulations as an
#' animated figure (`autogif` function).
